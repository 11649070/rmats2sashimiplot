# rmats2sashimiplot

Requirements
------------

rmats2sashimiplot is intended to be used in a Unix-based environment. It has
been tested on Mac OS and Linux.

A working installation of Python is required.

Installation
------------

### Install ###
The package, rmats2sashimiplot is installed by typing:

    python setup.py install

User executables and scripts will be placed into /path/to/rPGA/bin and
/path/to/rPGA/scripts respectively. These cannot be moved, as the pipeline
expects them to remain here. We suggest you modify your PATH environment
variable to include these directories, but it is not required. All of the
below instructions assume these directories are in your PATH variable; if not,
replace the names of the scripts/executable with their full path.

Usage
-----

Before you can begin working on a project with rPGA, you need to initialize the
project directory. To do this, run:

    $ rmats2sashimiplot ...
